                        <p>In her development plan, a pastoral centre stands out as a major vehicle through which the diocese intends to continue her work of development outside the four walls of the Church, touching the lives of other members of our immediate society and neighborhoods, who do not necessarily belong to the Catholic faith or even the Christian fold. The diocese is more inspired to do this under the mandate of Our Lord Jesus Christ, who came "that they may have life, and have it more abundantly, *Jn 10:10* The proposed pastoral centre will offer spiritual, pastoral and evangelization programmes as well as hospital services. It will also have professional management component with capabilities and competencies in the following areas: Spiritual Development, Human Resource Management and Career Counseling.</p>
