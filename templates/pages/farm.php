                        <p>Everybody believes that the future of most economies lies in agriculture. In Nigeria, unfortunately, interest has been focused on oil at the great detriment of agriculture. Awgu diocese is a rural diocese with a rural population, majority of who are farmers.He economic situation in the entire Awgu diocese is not much good news.It can be said and rightly so that more than 90% of the white collar job working force of Awgu indigene live outside Awgu. The reason is not far to fetch- there are little or no employment opportunity in Awgu. No industries. No companies. No production firms. The only job paying offers that exist are the Local Government Public Servants in the 3 identified Local Governments- most of whom again reside outside Awgu and visit home only at Christmas, Easter, Major Feasts and Family Gettogether like, Marriages, Burials and the like.</p>
